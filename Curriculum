# This is my first draft of an DevOps Curriculum

## Areas of Skills for an DevOps position
1) DevOps Concepts (terminology and philosophy)
2) Infrastructure (Linux/unix based editing, monitiroring and command based tools)
3) Cloud- Infrasturcture 8AWS, maxbe azure)
4) Coding/scripting (Bash/Powershell/Python/Java/Javascript)
5) DevOps Tools (git, Jenkins(build and test)m chef (configuration management), AWS
  (deployment))
6) Virtualization Know-How
7) Database knowledge

## Current Skill Level
1) 0/10 Not explored
2) 3/10 Some Linux sysadmin tasks, vim user
3) 1/10 Installed an AWS account and wrote an lmbda function for Alexa
4) 3/10 Wrote simple code and testing C++/Java/Python/Bash.
  configured build scripts with make and cmake
5) 1/10 used git as backup of commitments
6) 0/0 I used virtualbox but nothing of the theory behind it
7) 0/0 I know only some basic terminology


## General Plan
get about average in every area (6+) until 31.12.2019

One hour before work at academic and high level things which
aren't linked to my job right now (programming principles, Cloud/Linux stuff,
Virtualization).

I try to learn anything at my job as deep as possible so I can gather experience
in the subjects (code macros, know our database, take sysadmin responisbility if
offered, Rest-Api scripts. general admin-methodoly)

I listen to Audiobooks and read blogs and Quora in my free time to immerse
myself in the topic.

I need to create an actionable outline of topics, courses and certifications
for the upcoming 21 Months or 91 weeks .
